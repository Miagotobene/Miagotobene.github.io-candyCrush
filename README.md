# How to Play
Candy Crush is a puzzle-like game where you match colorful candies to earn points. The goal is to swipe candies to make rows or columns of three or four candies of the same color. When you create a match of candies, they disappear and new candies are randomly generated. Since this is a beginner-friendly game, the goal is simple: earn as many points as you possibly can! You score 3 points for matching a set of three candies and 4 points for matching a set of four candies.

You can move the candies around by simply dragging them. When you drag and make a valid move, you can either change the position of a candy or create a matching set.

PS: You can earn bonus points even before starting the game. This is because automatic matches may exist when the game is reset and candies are randomly generated.
